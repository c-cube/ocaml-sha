## v1.15.1

Opam CI fixes by @MisterDA (#54):

- update to Dune 2.9 to fix [lint warning](https://opam.ci.ocaml.org/github/ocaml/opam-repository/commit/8cf1e193733c6d6c0330b46c1a7b7a2819e9a977/variant/(lint));
  > (lint) (failed: Warning in sha.1.15: Dubious use of 'dune subst'. 'dune subst' should always only be called with {dev} (i.e. ["dune" "subst"] {dev}) If your opam file has been autogenerated by dune, you need to upgrade your dune-project to at least (lang dune 2.7).)
- define `Bytes_val` ourselves before OCaml 4.06;
- add setup-ocaml GitHub action to catch mistakes earlier.
